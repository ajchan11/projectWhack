1. Name of the game: Whack a Mole

2. Objective: Whack as many dictators as quickly as possible within the 30 second time limit. Minus 10 points for hitting the Dalai Lama!

3. Began constructing the game with a simple layout of 8 x 3 squares

4. Game will keep track of correctly clicked boxes and will change in speed depending on difficulty (and score if I figure out how to do that).

5. Game will end when player mis-clicks and the appropriate box is not clicked. 

6. User Stories 
  1. The 9 year old boy wants to play an arcade game to get a new high score.
  2. The college student wants to kill time while waiting for next class to start.
  3. The young entrepreneur wants to figure out how he can monoitize a family game.
