Name of the game: Whack a Mole

Objective: Whack as many dictators as quickly as possible within the 30 second time limit. Minus 10 points for hitting the Dalai Lama!

1. Began constructing the game with a simple layout of 8 x 3 squares and assigned each box to an array.

2. Used a random number generator that cycles through the array of squares, randomly choosing one. The chosen box is given an additional class name.

4. Game will keep track of correctly clicked boxes and will change in speed depending on difficulty (and score if I figure out how to do that).

5. Game will end when player mis-clicks and the appropriate box is not clicked. 

6. User Stories 
  1. The 9 year old boy wants to play an arcade game to get a new high score.
  2. The college student wants to kill time while waiting for next class to start.
  3. The young entrepreneur wants to figure out how he can monoitize a family game.
